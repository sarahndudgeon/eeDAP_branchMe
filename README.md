# Progress log and general notes file for Sarah’s brain dump

## Repo Contents:
* eeDAP input files for demo and other tasks


## General Comments:
* I could use another GitHub lesson from Brandon to get my branching & Merging skills up to date
 * Also good to ask him where in the FDA repo space he wants new eeDAP work to go
  * Applies to Sarah + Kate & HS students working on commenting/organizing code this summer.
* For now, these edits are in their own repo: eeDAP_branchMe
